# randomAffirmations
This app will generate random affirmations with the use of JS and API's

## Background
This was a project from Codecademy. The assigment was to use what we have learned so far about git, CLI, and arrays to create a random message generator. 
I taught myself enough about fetch, async/wait funtions and the date method to get this working. I used the affirmations.dev API to randomly generate the messages. 

## Features
The program does have any feature in the current version.

## How to use
Run the code in a Node.js environment and it will log the time and two random affirmations.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- APIs
